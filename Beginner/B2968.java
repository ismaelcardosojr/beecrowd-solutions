/* 
Vinicius takes his fitness very seriously, and every morning at 6 a.m., rain or shine, in summer and winter, he runs in a track around a pond. 
Along the race track there are N equally spaced signs. To not be discouraged from exercising, Vinicius counts the number of signs he has passed and 
checks to see if he has run at least 10%, at least 20%, . . . , at least 90% of his training.

Letâ€™s help Vinicius by calculating for him the number of signs he needs to count to have completed at least 10%, 20%, . . . , 90% of his training, 
given the number of laps he wants to run and the total number of signs along the track

For example, suppose Vinicius wants to run 3 laps and the track has 17 signs. To ensure that he has run at least 30% of his training, he needs 
to count 16 signs. To guarantee at least 60%, he needs to count 31 signs.
